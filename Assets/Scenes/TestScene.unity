    business as usual today?</size></b>\n\nClimate change \u201Cat a rate faster than
    at any time since the end of the ice age \u2013 change too fast perhaps for life
    to adapt, without severe dislocation.\u201D That was the startling warning issued
    by the oil giant Shell more than a quarter of a century ago.\r\n\r\nThe company\u2019s
    farsighted 1991 film, titled\_Climate of Concern, set out with crystal clarity
    how fossil fuel burning was warming the world and that serious consequences could
    well result.\r\n\u201CTropical islands barely afloat even now, first made inhabitable,
    and then obliterated beneath the waves [\u2026] coastal lowlands everywhere suffering
    pollution of precious groundwater, on which so much farming and so many cities
    depend,\u201D says the film\u2019s narrator, over disturbing images of people
    affected by natural disasters and famine. \u201CIn a crowded world subject to
    such adverse shifts of climate, who would take care of such greenhouse refugees?\u201D
    \r\n\r\nThe film acknowledged the uncertainties in the computer model predictions
    at the time, but noted the various scenarios had \u201Ceach prompted the same
    serious warning, a warning endorsed by a uniquely broad consensus of scientists
    in their report to the United Nations at the end of 1990.\u201D\r\n\u201CWhat
    they foresee is not a steady and even warming overall, but alterations to the
    familiar patterns of climate, and the increasing frequency of abnormal weather,\u201D
    it cautioned. \u201CIt is thought that warmer seas could make destructive [storm]
    surges more frequent and even more ferocious.\u201D\r\n\u201CWhether or not the
    threat of global warming proves as grave as the scientists predict, is it too
    much to hope as it might act as the stimulus \u2013 the catalyst \u2013 to a new
    era of technical and economic cooperation?\u201D the film concludes. \u201COur
    numbers are many, and infinitely diverse. But the problems and dilemmas of climatic
    change concern us all.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe film was made for public viewing, particularly
    in schools and universities, but is believed to have been unseen for many years.
    It was remarkably prescient, according to Prof. Tom Wigley, who was head of the
    Climate Research Unit at the University of East Anglia when it helped Shell with
    the 1991 film.\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s amazing it\u2019s 25 years ago. Incredible,\u201D
    he said. \u201CIt was quite comprehensive on what might happen, what the consequences
    are, and what we can do about it. I mean, there\u2019s not much more.\u201D He
    said that the predictions for temperature and sea level rises in the 1991 film
    were \u201Cpretty good, compared with current understanding.\u201D \r\n\r\n\u201CWhat\u2019s
    really striking is nothing has happened [since] to make you doubt the science
    as it was stated then,\u201D said Tom Burke, at the green thinktank E3G and a
    former member of Shell\u2019s external review committee.\r\nBut Shell\u2019s actions
    on global warming since 1991, such as major investments in highly polluting tar
    sands and lobbying against climate action, have been heavily criticized. In 2015,
    it was accused of\_behaving like a \u201Cpsychopath\u201D\_by the UK\u2019s former
    climate change envoy and of being engaged in a cynical attempt to block action
    on global warming. Even its own former group managing director, Sir Mark Moody-Stuart,
    said in 2015 it was \u201Cdistressing\u201C remarkably little progress\u201D\_had
    been made on climate change by Shell and other oil companies.\r\n\r\nThe revelation
    of the film,\_.obtained by De Correspondent\_and shared with the Guardian, has
    renewed the criticism.\u201C The film shows that Shell understood that the threat
    was dire, potentially existential for civilization, more than a quarter of a century
    ago,\u201D said Jeremy Leggett, a solar power entrepreneur and former geologist
    who had earlier researched shale deposits with Shell and BP funding.\r\n\r\n\u201CI
    see to this day how they doggedly argue for rising gas use, decades into the future,
    despite the clear evidence that fossil fuels have to be phased out completely,\u201D
    he said. \u201CI honestly feel that this company is guilty of a modern form of
    crime against humanity. They will point out that they have behaved no differently
    than their peers, BP, Exxon, and Chevron. For people like me, of which there are
    many, that is no defense.\u201D\r\nPaul Spedding, HSBC\u2019s former global head
    of oil and gas and now at the thinktank Carbon Tracker, said about half of Shell\u2019s
    reserve base is natural gas, the least carbon intensive of the fossil fuels. \u201CHowever,
    its oil portfolio could be a ticking tar-sands time bomb. Tar sands, which make
    up nearly 30% of group oil reserves, are significantly more carbon intensive than
    conventional oil. As things stand, Shell\u2019s oil production is destined to
    become heavier, higher cost, and higher carbon, hardly a profile that fits the
    outlook described in Shell\u2019s video.\u201D\r\n\r\nShell had, in fact, known
    of the risks of climate change even earlier. A \u201Cconfidential\u201D company
    report written in 1986, also seen by the Guardian, noted the significant uncertainties
    in climate science at the time but warned of the possibility of \u201Cfast and
    dramatic\u201D changes that \u201Cwould impact on the human environment, future
    living standards, and food supplies, and could have major social, economic, and
    political consequences.\u201D\r\nIn 1989, Shell had already taken the effects
    of climate change into account\_in the construction of an oil rig. But in the
    same year, the so-called Global Climate Coalition (GCC)\_\_was formed by the major
    oil companies, including Shell\u2019s US operation Shell Oil. It lobbied hard
    to cast doubt on climate science and oppose government action, and in 1998 Shell
    withdrew,\_citing \u201Cirreconcilable\u201D differences.\r\nHowever, Shell\_
    remained a member\_of another business lobby group that campaigned against climate
    action, the American Legislative Exchange Council, until 2015 and remains a member
    of the Business Roundtable and American Petroleum Institute, which both fought
    against Barack Obama\u2019s Clean Power Plan.\r\nThe company has said it has remained
    a member of groups that hold different views on climate action\_to \u201Cinfluence\u201D
    them.\_\_But Thomas O\u2019Neill, from the group Influence Map, which tracks lobbying,
    said: \u201CThe trade associations and industry groups are there to say things
    the company cannot or does not want to say. It\u2019s deliberately that way.\u201D\r\n\r\n\r\nShell
    has also\_ lobbied directly to undermine European renewable energy targets, a
    sector it has invested in, although at a much lower level than oil and gas. In
    2016, Shell launched its New Energies division, with annual spending less than
    1%\_of the total $30 billion Shell pumps into oil and gas.\r\nDespite the company\u2019s
    public support since the 1990s for carbon taxes to drive cuts in emissions, Shell\_lobbied
    in 2015 for exemptions\_\_for the electricity it produces and uses, particularly
    for its offshore oil and gas platforms.\r\n\r\nSome of Shell\u2019s investments
    today are also criticized for being incompatible with the 2\xB0C warming target
    agreed by the world\u2019s nations. A 2015\_Carbon Tracker report\_\_concluded
    the company was planning to invest more than $75 billion in such projects over
    the following decade, part of a \u201Ccarbon bubble\u201D in which reserves are
    being developed that cannot be burned if climate change is to be halted \u2013
    a concern\_ shared by the Bank of England and World Bank\_.\r\n\r\nAnother Carbon
    Tracker report in 2016 cited a 1998 Shell document showing\_ the company was aware
    of this risk.\_\u201CShell knew about, but did not act on, the risks of a carbon
    bubble,\u201D the report said. \u201CLooking back over the last 20 years, it seems
    like Shell has gone backwards in terms of transparency, and is still recycling
    the same old green initiatives, and attempting to deflect responsibility in the
    face of an existential threat to its business.\u201D\r\nShell was one of the first
    major oil companies to acknowledge the need to act on climate change and has long
    argued that providing affordable energy was vital for the world and its development.
    The 1991 film anticipated the problem: \u201CHow could [developing] countries
    continue to advance but leapfrog the energy-intensive phase of development, by
    which other nations prospered before its adverse consequences came to light?\u201D\r\nBut
    in 2015 its own external review committee concluded Shell\u2019s sustainability
    report did not \u201Cadequately convey the urgency of this [low-carbon energy]
    transition.\u201D\_Earlier in February, Shell\u2019s CEO Ben van Beurden said:
    \u201CWe believe that climate change is real and we believe that action will be
    needed.\u201D\r\nMoody-Stuart, who was also chairman of Shell from 1998-2002,
    told the Guardian the broad criticism of the company was unfair. \u201CI don\u2019t
    think enough has been done, but I wouldn\u2019t single out the oil industry. Governments
    and others have some responsibility, and Shell and others have called for a price
    on carbon since the 1990s.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIt hasn\u2019t got very far at all
    but that is not Shell\u2019s fault,\u201D he said. \u201CIt is pretty unique for
    an industry to be actually asking for something which will increase the price
    of their product, but they are asking for it because that is what is needed to
    drive the industry in the right direction.\u201D\r\nBurke, a former head of Friends
    of the Earth, agreed there is a wider problem. \u201CIt is too easy to blame it
    all on Shell for getting it wrong,\u201D he said, as there has been \u201Ca broader
    societal failure.\u201D\r\nShell\u2019s 1986 report said the climate change problem
    was one that \u201Cultimately only governments can tackle.\u201D But it also noted,
    over three decades ago, that the energy industry \u201Chas very strong interests
    at stake and much expertise to contribute. It also has its own reputation to consider,
    there being much potential for public anxiety and pressure group activity.\u201D\n\n\n\n"
